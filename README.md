#  Game Programming project 2012

Developed by Jeroen Kools & Fedde Burgers, for the course 
[Game Programming](http://studiegids.uva.nl/web/uva/2011_2012/en/c/6697.html) taught by Frank Aldershoff at the 
University of Amsterdam.

## Introduction  
This game is an open source implementation of the classical board game of Stratego (see [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratego), 
[boardgamegeek](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1917/stratego)), 
with some gameplay changes and additions, such as configurable board size and optional rules like diagonal movement. Other differences 
from the traditional game, that might be added in the future, are fog of war (i.e. limited sight distance), new special units and multiplayer support.

The current working title is _Kindral_, which is Estonian for 'general'.

## News  
For the latest developments, see the [SVN change log](http://code.google.com/p/gpfj/source/list).

## Requirements  
The easiest way to play Kindral is to download the latest [binary version](https://code.google.com/p/gpfj/downloads/list). 
Unzip and start the executable. The requirements are simple:
  * Windows XP or newer

If you prefer running from the Python [source code](https://code.google.com/p/gpfj/source/checkout), that is more platform independent, but there are a few dependencies:
  * Python: 2.6 compatible, but 2.7 is preferred. 3.x won't work.
  * [Python Imaging Library](http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/)
  * A Windows operating system is required for the sound effects, but is _not_ necessary to run the game - it has also been tested on OSX Lion and Ubuntu 11. 
  * [mp3play](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/mp3play/) is required for music playback
