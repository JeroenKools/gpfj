#summary Adding new computer opponents to Kindral

If you know some Python, it is easy to add your own computer opponent, or "brain", to Kindral, whether you are using the .exe or the source code.

== Creating a minimal brain ==

To start with, you can copy and rename an existing brain, like the pretty basic [randomBrain], and start adjusting that.

An alternative is to subclass randomBrain and override {{{placeArmy}}} and {{{findMove}}}. In that case, the skeleton would look like this:

{{{
import randomBrain

class Brain(randomBrain.Brain):
    #def placeArmy(self):
    # uncomment and add code to override randomBrain's placeArmy

    #def findMove(self):
    # uncomment and add code to override randomBrain's findMove
}}}

== Making sure Kindral sees your custom brain ==

To make the game able to use your brain script, you need to insert the name of the file in {{{brains\__init__.py}}}.

For example, if you named your customized brain {{{myCustomBrain.py}}}, the resulting __init__.py should look like this:

{{{
__all__ = ["Brain",
           "CarefulBrain",
           "randomBrain",
           "SmartBrain",
           "SurpriseBrain",
           "myCustomBrain"]  # <----- new brain added here
}}}
