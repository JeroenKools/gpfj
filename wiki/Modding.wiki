If you know some Python, it is easy to add your own computer opponent, or "brain", to Kindral.

== Creating a minimal brain ==

To start with, you can copy and rename an existing brain, like the pretty basic [randomBrain], and start adjusting that.

An alternative is to subclass randomBrain and override {{{placeArmy}}} and {{{findMove}}}. In that case, the skeleton would look like this:

{{{
import randomBrain

class Brain(randomBrain.Brain):
    #def placeArmy(self):
    # uncomment and add code to override randomBrain's placeArmy

    #def findMove(self):
    # uncomment and add code to override randomBrain's findMove
}}}

== Making sure Kindral sees your custom brain ==

To make the game able to use your brain script, you need to insert the name of the file in {{{brains\__init__.py}}}.

For example, the resulting __init__.py could look like this:

{{{
__all__ = ["Brain",
           "CarefulBrain",
           "randomBrain",
           "SmartBrain",
           "SurpriseBrain",
           "myCustomBrain"]  # <----- new brain added here
}}}
